"""Redo moments (RF-4, the shared definition ST-7 stands on).

A redo moment is a tool call whose tool and input match an
earlier tool call in the same tape, with an error tool
result answering the earlier call in between. The moment is
recorded at the later call's seq. Inputs are compared by
their canonical form 1 bytes, so two inputs that differ
only in key order are the same call, and two that differ in
any value are not. The tape has already passed the format
checks in tapes.py, so a result's call id answers an
earlier call and arrives after it; an error recorded for a
call is therefore always in between that call and any
later repeat examined here. Earlier calls are indexed by
their tool and input, so detection stays linear in the
size of the tape.
